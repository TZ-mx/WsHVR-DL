# WsHVR-DL
The paper proposes a wireless sensing and deep learning-based human-vehicle recognition (WsHVR-DL) method, which can be applied in ISLSs that assembled with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). To solve the problem of limited recognition ability and difficulty in implementation of wireless sensing technologies, this paper introduces a deep feature extraction model that combines multi-scale convolution and attention mechanism. The received signal strength (RSS) features of road users are extracted by multi-scale convolution. WsHVR-DL integrates an Adaptive Registration Convolutional Attention Mechanism (ARCAM) to further extract features. The final classification result is calculated by Softmax activation function.
